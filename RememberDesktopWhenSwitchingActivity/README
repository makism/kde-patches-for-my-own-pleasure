RememberDesktopWhenSwitchingActivity

See kde bugs:
 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=265015

 and possibly more...

The problem is as follows:
 Say you have two (or more activities) A and B.
 You are working on activity A on Desktop 4.
 You switch to activity B (and by default to Desktop 4).
 Change to Desktop 1.
 Go back to activity A and (by default) to Desktop 1, while it should move you to Desktop 4 (this is where my patch kicks in).
