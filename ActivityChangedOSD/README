ActivityChangedOSD

*****************************************************************
	This is code in testing, needs much more loving.
*****************************************************************

* For the time being, only the Activity's name is shown.
* The code is mostly based on KWin's OSD and KRunner's Quicksand interface.

See kde bugs:
  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=265456

When changing to another activity, display in OSD
that activity's name.

Apply patches to:
	kdelibs/kactivities/service/

Kill and restart kactivitymanagerd
