#ActivityChangedOSD#
####This is code in testing, needs much more loving.####
---

* The alignment is messed up when composition is disabled (need more info).
* The code is mostly based on KWin's OSD and KRunner's Quicksand interface.

See kde bugs:
* https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=265456

When changing to another activity, display in OSD
that activity's name.

Apply patches to: **kactivities/service/**

Kill and restart kactivitymanagerd
